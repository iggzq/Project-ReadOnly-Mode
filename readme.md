# Project-ReadOnly-Plugin

### This is an IDEA plugin designed to set the code as read-only when we are reading source code downloaded from the internet, preventing accidental modifications caused by inadvertent keyboard touches.

The plugin has already been uploaded to the JetBrains Plugin Marketplace. You can find it at [this link](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26974-project-read-only-mode).
